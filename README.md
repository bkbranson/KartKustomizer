This project's repo is the result of cloning the repo https://github.com/tharveypa/final-project-start, which was used by Dr. Harvey to facilitate the creation of a react-dnd project. I am cloning this repo due to it being pre-configured with eslint and gh-pages (this is mentioned within his repo's README.md).

This project KartKustomizer allows the user to create a combination of character and kart parts and see the overall stats. In the first revision it is going to do everything locally (the data will be contained in a component or relevant text/csv file). Upon completion it may be converted to scrape the data from the web. All of the images and statistics used were obtained from https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe_in-game_statistics, the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe wiki.
